#  Copy of the amazing HTML5 Boilerplate [http://html5boilerplate.com](http://html5boilerplate.com) with my own tweaks.

Warning: this it my own personal version of the HTML5 Boilderplate and so will almost certainly be not as good as the original. The html5 boilerplate website has excellent documentation on how to use it so I won't bother repeating it here. I will just add information on what I have added. 

## Additions:

<ul>
    <li>960.gs</li>
    <li>Less</li>
</ul>
